This code generates Ansible dynamic inventory from OneOps.  If can be executed
against either a single environment or multiple environments in a single
assembly.

## Executing OneOps Inventory for an Environment

Set four environment variables: you OO API token, Org, Assembly, and Env:

	export OO_API_TOKEN="XYZ123USEYOUROWN"
	export OO_ORG="devtools"
	export OO_ASSEMBLY="website"
	export OO_ENV="prod"
	export OO_ENDPOINT="https://prod.oneops.com"

Build this tool:

	mvn clean install

## Use the Inventory Tool with an Ansible Playbook

This repository contains a Python wrapper that can be called directly from Ansible.

	ansible-playbook -i ~/wherever/oo-wrapper.py yourplaybook.yml

Go forth and Ansible.

## Test the Inventory Tool

Run the Inventory tool:

	java -jar target/oo-inventory.jar --list

This will generate _meta as well as hostvars.  To retrieve a specific host:

	java -jar target/oo-inventory.jar --host 100.65.3.247

## Pointing to a different OneOps instance?

You can also define an OO_ENDPOINT environment variable if you need to point to a different API endpoint. 

	export OO_ENDPOINT="http://whatever.oneops.instance.you.want/"

## Want Private IPs or Hostnames?

This inventory script assumes that you want public_ip addresses, but OneOps
keeps track of public and private IP addresses.   Also, if a design has a
hostname component each compute also has two hostnames.

To use OO public IP addresses set the OO_HOST_METHOD environment variable to "public_ip".

	export OO_HOST_METHOD="public_ip"

To use OO private IP addresses set the OO_HOST_METHOD environment variable to "private_ip".

	export OO_HOST_METHOD="private_ip"

To use OO hostnames set the OO_HOST_METHOD environment variable to "hostname".

	export OO_HOST_METHOD="hostname"

If you use hostnames your Ansible dynamic inventory will use host names to
define groups, e.g.:

	"platform-webserver-compute": [
		"webserver-198391581-1-224621269.prod.website.devtools.dal3.prod.oneops.com",
		"webserver-198391581-2-224621275.prod.website.devtools.dal3.prod.oneops.com",
		"webserver-198391587-2-224621357.prod.website.devtools.dfw3.prod.oneops.com",
		"webserver-198391587-1-224621351.prod.website.devtools.dfw3.prod.oneops.com"
	]
